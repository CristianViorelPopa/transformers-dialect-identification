# Source Code - paper

The code here is meant to be run directly, as all the local paths are hardcoded inside. Thus, you need to modify it to use the correct values.

Summary of the scripts:
- `models_roc_comparison.py` - plots the figure with the ROCs of the different models we experimented with
- `spacy_vs_no_spacy.py` - plots the figure with the ROCs of the mBERT model with and without the split of articles into sentences
